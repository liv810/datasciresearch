# Data science research projects

Compilation of research projects that occupy the intersection of data science and statistics.  I have chosen to omit machine-learning focused tools here.

## Automated analysis

* [The Automatic Statistician](https://www.automaticstatistician.com/index/) attempts to fully automate the exploratory data analysis process. 

 It autogenerates 10-15 page [reports](https://www.automaticstatistician.com/examples/), with the ability to fit time-series and linear models, and to interpret these models.


## Exploratory data analysis (EDA) helpers

* [Statsplorer](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/statsplorer) provides a friendly GUI with which non-coders and non-statistical experts can perform statistical analysis.

 It automates simple exploratory data analysis (e.g., histograms) and detects problematic data (e.g., outlier detection, testing which assumptions are held, and automatically suggesting tests that violate few assumptions).

* [Facets](https://github.com/PAIR-code/facets) provides two interactive GUIs that provide visual exploration of the features of your dataset.  Developed by Google.

 Facets Overview generates summary statistics on the features of a dataset (e.g., count, \% missing, median, std dev).  

 Facets Dive enables a cross-sectional view of your data.  For example, for a Census dataset you can bucket people's ages into 5-year increments and then color it by the person's occupation in order to get a visual overview of how occupations change as people age.

## Model explorers

* [What-If Tool](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/) provides an interactive GUI that enables comparing two different models' performance on a dataset.  Developed by People + AI Research Initiative (PAIR) at Google.


## Teaching

* [Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu) makes basic concepts of statistics (e.g., probability distributions, variance, linear models) more accessible through interactive visualizations.

* Amelia McNamara's [Exploring Histograms](http://tinlizzie.org/histograms/) demonstrates how to visualize the mapping of raw data onto a histogram.

* Nick Huntington-Klein's explanation of basic causal inference methods via causal graphs and corresponding [animated plots](http://nickchk.com/causalgraphs.html) that show what these causal methods do behind the scenes.

### Online statistics books
* [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro) is the textbook for Berkeley's introductory Data 8 class, and is written in the Jupyter Book format.

* [SticiGui](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/) is written by Philip Stark and emphasizes an intuitive approach of translating real-world situations into statistical constructs.


## Design of notation
* Great overview [here](https://github.com/hypotext/notation).
