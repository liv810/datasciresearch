# Data science research projects

Compilation of research projects that occupy the intersection of data science and statistics.  I have chosen to omit machine-learning focused tools here.

## Automated analysis

* [The Automatic Statistician](https://www.automaticstatistician.com/index/) generates 10-15 page [reports](https://www.automaticstatistician.com/examples/) that use Bayesian model selection strategies to automatically find time-series patterns or linear models, and to interpret them.


## Exploratory data analysis (EDA) helpers

* [Statsplorer](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/statsplorer) provides a friendly GUI where non-coders and non-statistical experts can perform simple exploratory data analysis (e.g., histograms), with automatic detection for problematic data (e.g., outlier detection) and violated assumptions.

* [Facets](https://github.com/PAIR-code/facets) provides two interactive GUIs (Facets Overview and Facets Dive) to explore cross-sectional slices of your dataset.  Developed by Google.

## Model explorers

* [What-If Tool](https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/) provides an interactive GUI that enables comparing two different models' performance on a dataset.  Developed by People + AI Research Initiative (PAIR) at Google.


## Teaching

* [Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu) makes basic concepts of statistics (e.g., probability distributions, variance, linear models) more accessible through interactive visualizations.

* [Explained Visually](http://setosa.io/ev/) allows interactive manipulation of datapoints to understand the interface between data and certain models (e.g., ordinary least squares, PCA, conditional probability).

* Amelia McNamara's [Exploring Histograms](http://tinlizzie.org/histograms/) demonstrates how to visualize the mapping of raw data onto a histogram.

* Nick Huntington-Klein's explanation of basic causal inference methods via causal graphs and corresponding [animated plots](http://nickchk.com/causalgraphs.html) that demonstrate what these causal methods do behind the scenes.

### Online statistics books
* [Computational and Inferential Thinking](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro) is the textbook for Berkeley's introductory Data 8 class, and is written in the Jupyter Book format.

* [SticiGui](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/SticiGui/) is written by Philip Stark and emphasizes an intuitive approach of translating real-world situations into statistical constructs.

## Programming tools

* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) is a graphing package for R developed by Hadley Wickham, based on the grammar of graphics, which makes aesthetically-pleasing and easy-to-manipulate graphics.

* [MeterStick] provides a syntax to describe, construct, and execute data analysis tasks in Python, in a tidyverse-like style.

* [Symbulate] is a Python package to simulate directly from user-specified probability models (as opposed to repeatedly-drawn datasets).

* [nbinteract](https://www.samlau.me/projects/2017-09-01-nbinteract) enables easy creation of instructional interactive data science content within Jupyter notebooks, with minimal web-dev skills.


## Design of notation
* Great overview of notational systems [here](https://github.com/hypotext/notation).
